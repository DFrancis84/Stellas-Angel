# Stella's Angel
This page is dedicated to Stella's Angel.  Stella's Angel is a local organization that helps the elderly at Sacred Heart Village in Louisville, KY.  They provide entertainment and assistance to the occupants. Currently, they only have a Facebook page.  I created this website to help broaden their level of visibility as there is still some people who do not have Facebook.

## Functionality
Within this website, it allows the organization to show current photos, as well as their calendar of events.  

It allows the users to view what events are coming up, send donations to them via PayPal link, and email them with any other additional questions.  The form feature is non-functioning at the moment as there is no back-end work completed.  That is the next process.
